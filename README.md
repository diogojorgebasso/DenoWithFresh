# A simple API for estimating the Geolocation of a client. 

## What is Fresh?
"Fresh is a next generation web framework, built for speed, reliability, and simplicity." according them.
However, I shall put Fresh as the first framework to implement this technologies. As the times passes, and I used it, I will comment it out in my [TIL](https://github.com/diogojorgebasso/TIL) (Today I learn repository).

## Advantages of using Fresh
- TypeScript by default;
- Server side rendering;
- Deno by default;

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
